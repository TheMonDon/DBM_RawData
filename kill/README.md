# Kill Command
Original Command Author: BrainStorm#0007

A kill command Similar to Dank Memer's kill command where you mention a user and it sends a message about how The Command Author Killed Them.
Usage: [p]kill @user

I added more responses and changed all the "jump to action" to "skip actions" to work with my blacklist system.
Also posting to github as original is a link to ghostpin which is shutting down.


Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
Note2: Only need latest version, leaving _ORIGINAL_ as a key to original author.
At this point I have changed the entire thing and added a lot more sentences and felt time to make it a seperate thing.
