# Description
This is a large/advaned ticket system which is in its beta phases. I believe everything is working but I am not 100% sure. Please report any problems to me on discord: TheMonDon#1721

# What is this for?
I am planning on adding role reaction event, this will be for that! Check back soon!

# How do I enable it?
To get the basic system up and running run the command `supportSetup`, if it's already set up it will tell you.
To enable the role reaction menu run the command `reactSetup`.

# If you have any suggestions or things to change, let me know!
