# DBM_RawData
My Raw Data things for DBM

This is no longer maintained and will 100% not work with the current version of DBM (Discord Bot Maker).
I don't understand why you people are forking this.

Note: The included first parts about the blacklist and global command variable are not required to work and can be removed if you're not planning on using those functions, I include them in *most* my commands as its a complete system I use. They will automatically count towards the botinfo command rawdata and the blacklist command to work relatively simple.
