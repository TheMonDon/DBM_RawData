# DBM_RawData
My Raw Data things for DBM

Note: The included first parts about the blacklist and global command variable are not required to work and can be removed if you're not planning on using those functions, I include them in all my commands as its a complete system I use. They will automatically count towards the botinfo command rawdata and the blacklist command to work relatively simple.
