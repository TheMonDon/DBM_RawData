# Jail Command (Command Author & Mentioned User)
Original Author: SketchFX#6700

I took this command from Sketch and fixed it up, as his bars photo has poofed off the internet. This now also works without needing to mention a user.

Puts jail bars over your or a mentioned users profile pic. Makes the pic more grey-scaled and then sends the image to chat, pretty simple. 

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
